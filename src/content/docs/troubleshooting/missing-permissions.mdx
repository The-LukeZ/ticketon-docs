import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import ImageWrapper from "../../../components/ImageWrapper.astro";

This is what you might see if you try to create a ticket:

<ImageWrapper size="xl">
  ![Missing Permissions Error
  Example](../../../assets/docs/errors/missing-permissions-for-ticket-create.png)
</ImageWrapper>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Channel Mode">
    **Check Bot Permissions for the Category**: Ticketon follows the principle of least privilege. You have two options:

    #### Option 1: Add Ticketon to the Category (Recommended)
    - Add the Ticketon role (or bot user) to the category where tickets are created
    - The bot will inherit permissions from the server-level role settings
    - This is the most secure approach

    #### Option 2: Grant Manage Server Permission

    - Give the Ticketon role the "Manage Server" permission
    - This grants the bot broader access across the server
    - Only use this if you fully trust the bot

    ##### Required permissions (either through category or server role):
    - Manage Server **(OPTIONAL, only it you trust the bot fully)**
    - Manage Channels
    - Manage Permissions
    - View Channel
    - Send Messages
    - Read Message History
    - Embed Links
    - Attach Files
    - Use External Emojis

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Threads Mode">
    **Check Bot Permissions for the Channel**: Ensure the bot has the following permissions in the channel where tickets are created:

        - Create Private Threads
        - Manage Threads
        - View Channel
        - Send Messages
        - Read Message History
        - Embed Links
        - Attach Files
        - Use External Emojis

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
