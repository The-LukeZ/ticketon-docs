The `/blacklist` command allows moderators to prevent users from creating tickets in the server.
This can be useful for managing users who have abused the ticketing system or for temporarily restricting access to support tickets.

This command is available to members with the **Moderate Members** permission by default.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `add`      | Add a user to the server blacklist         |
| `remove`   | Remove a user from the server blacklist    |
| `check`    | Check if a user is in the server blacklist |

## Usage

### Add a User to the Blacklist

To add a user to the server blacklist, use the following command:

```
/blacklist add user:@user reason:Spamming
```

This will prevent the specified user from creating new tickets in the server.

### Remove a User from the Blacklist

To remove a user from the server blacklist, use the following command:

```
/blacklist remove user:@user
```

This will allow the specified user to create tickets again.

### Check if a User is Blacklisted

To check if a user is in the server blacklist, use the following command:

```
/blacklist check user:@user
```

This will return whether the specified user is currently blacklisted from creating tickets.

## Notes

- Blacklisted users will still be able to view and interact with existing tickets they have created prior to being blacklisted.
- Moderators can still open tickets for blacklisted users if necessary. See [Opening Tickets for Other Users](/commands/open-ticket-for) for more information.
- The blacklist is server-specific and does not affect the user's ability to create tickets in other servers using Ticketon.
