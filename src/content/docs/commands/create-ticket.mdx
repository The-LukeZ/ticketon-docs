The `/create-ticket` command allows users to create a new support ticket in the server without the need to use buttons/select menus.

This command is available to all members by default and does not require any special permissions.

When a user executes the `/create-ticket` command, the bot handles it like the user interacted with a panel message, either by opening a modal form (if configured) or directly creating the ticket.

## How to disable the command

To disable the `/create-ticket` command usage, you have to go in the **Server Settings** > **Integrations** > **Ticketon** > `/create-ticket` and disallow the usage for `@everyone`.
