## Ping Command

There is no dedicated ping command. Instead, you can check the bot's latency by mentioning it in any channel with `@Ticketon ping` (only in servers). The bot will respond with its status information and some links.

| Response Field    | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Ping          | Latency between the bot and Discord's API; Updates every few minutes                      |
| Roundtrip Latency | Time taken for the bot to respond (Bot > Discord > Bot); Calculated in real-time          |
| Uptime            | Duration the bot has been online since the last restart; Restarts happen to apply updates |
| Guilds            | Number of servers the bot is currently in                                                 |

#### Cooldown Period

To prevent spam, this feature has a cooldown of 1 minute per server. The bot will then just react with a ⏳ emoji if you mention it during a cooldown period.

## Out of Office Notice

The out of office notice is a message shown to users when they create a ticket while you're marked as out of office.
If enabled, users will see this notice when they open a ticket and ticket creation will be blocked until the notice it is removed again.
