## Using the `/close-request` Command

The `/close-request` command allows you to create a **close request** for a ticket. This command is versatile and can be used by both **staff members** and **users**, with slight differences in behavior.

### Key Features

- **For Staff Members**:  
   When a staff member creates a close request, the **user will be pinged** in the response message to confirm or deny the request.

- **For Users**:  
   When a user creates a close request, no ping is sent to the staff. The staff can then confirm or deny the request at their convenience.

### How It Works

1. **Staff Initiates Close Request**:  
    The user is notified and prompted to confirm or deny the request.

2. **User Initiates Close Request**:  
    The staff is notified (without a ping) and can confirm or deny the request.
