This page explains how to use the `ticket` command.

The `/ticket` command is **not intended for public use**. It is primarily designed for server staff to manage support tickets efficiently.
Therefore, it requires `Moderate Members` permission by default.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand              | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| list                    | Lists all open tickets                              |
| claim \*                | Claims a specified ticket for the command executor  |
| unclaim \*              | Unclaims a specified ticket                         |
| add \*                  | Adds up to 5 users to the ticket                    |
| remove \*               | Removes up to 5 users from the ticket               |
| transfer \*             | Transfers the ticket to a different ticket category |
| close-request create \* | Creates a close request for the ticket              |
| close-request revoke \* | Revokes an existing close request for the ticket    |
| close \*                | Closes the ticket in which the command is executed  |
| reopen \*\*             | Reopens a specified closed ticket                   |
| delete \*\*             | Deletes a specified ticket                          |
| close-all               | Closes all open tickets in the server               |
| delete-all              | Deletes all closed tickets in the server            |

\* This command is expected to be used within a ticket channel.  
\*\* This command can be used directly within a ticket channel. When used outside a ticket channel, a ticket ID must be provided.

Because most commands should be self-explanatory, only the more complex ones are explained below.

### Transfer Ticket

The `transfer` subcommand allows you to move a ticket to a different ticket category.
This doesn't inherently change the parent category of the ticket channel in the server, but if the new ticket category has
a different category for open tickets, the ticket channel will be moved to that category.

After executing the command, the bot will send a confirmation message in the ticket channel that it was moved.
Additionally, the permissions of the ticket channel will be updated to match the new staff roles (if it's not a thread ticket).

### Close Requests

A close request can be created by staff and the ticket author.

#### By Staff

Staff can use `/ticket close-request create` to create a close request for the ticket.

When a staff member creates a close request, the user is asked if they have further questions or all issues have been resolved.

Staff can also provide an **optional reason** for closing the ticket and an **optional close delay**.

Staff can revoke a close request if they change their mind before the ticket is closed.

#### By Ticket Author

<div>

The ticket author cannot use `/ticket close-request create` directly. Instead, they can have to select the "Close Request" from the ticket message menu.

When the ticket author creates a close request, staff are not pinged, and the author **has** to provide a reason for closing the ticket.

The author cannot revoke a close request once created. Staff has to take action on the close request.

#### Revoke a Close Request

Staff can revoke a close request if they change their mind before the ticket is closed.

To do that the command `/ticket close-request revoke` has to be executed in the ticket channel.

### Close All Tickets

The `/ticket close-all` command allows you to close all open tickets in your server with a single command. Optionally, you can provide a reason for closing the tickets and whether to delete the tickets after closing them.

When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to close all open tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.

### Delete All Tickets

The `/ticket delete-all` command allows you to delete all closed tickets in your server with a single command.

When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to delete all closed tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.
