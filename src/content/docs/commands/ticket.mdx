This page explains how to use the `ticket` command.

The `/ticket` command is **not intended for public use**. It is primarily designed for server staff to manage support tickets efficiently.
Therefore, it requires `Moderate Members` permission by default.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand              | Description                                                     |

| transfer \*             | Transfers the ticket to a different ticket category             |
| rename \*               | Renames the ticket channel to a new name (no variables allowed) |
| close-request create \* | Creates a close request for the ticket                          |
| close-request revoke \* | Revokes an existing close request for the ticket                |
| close \*                | Closes the ticket in which the command is executed              |
| reopen \*\*             | Reopens a specified closed ticket                               |
| delete \*\*             | Deletes a specified ticket                                      |
| close-all               | Closes all open tickets in the server                           |
| delete-all              | Deletes all closed tickets in the server                        |
| who-claimed \*          | Displays the name of the person who claimed the ticket          |

\* This command is expected to be used within a ticket channel.  
\*\* This command can be used directly within a ticket channel. When used outside a ticket channel, a ticket ID must be provided.

Because most commands should be self-explanatory, only the more complex ones are explained below.

### Transfer Ticket

The `transfer` subcommand allows you to move a ticket to a different ticket category.
This doesn't inherently change the parent category of the ticket channel in the server, but if the new ticket category has
a different category for open tickets, the ticket channel will be moved to that category.

### Close Requests

Staff can use `/ticket close-request create` to create a close request for the ticket.

When a staff member creates a close request, the ticket author is asked if they have further questions or all issues have been resolved.  
Staff can also provide an **optional reason** for closing the ticket and an **optional close delay**.  
If they change their mind before the ticket is closed, staff can revoke a close request by executing the `/ticket close-request` revoke command in the ticket channel.

### Close All Tickets

The `/ticket close-all` command allows you to close all open tickets in your server with a single command. Optionally, you can provide a reason for closing the tickets and whether to delete the tickets after closing them.  
When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to close all open tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.

### Delete All Tickets

The `/ticket delete-all` command allows you to delete all closed tickets in your server with a single command.  
When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to delete all closed tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.

### Check Who Claimed

The `/who-claimed` command will display the user who claimed the ticket. (Only works in tickets)

## Manage Ticket Access Control

### Who can interact with tickets

1. **Staff Members** - Users with staff roles defined on the ticket category OR manager roles defined for the server
   - Can perform all ticket actions: claim, unclaim, close, transfer, add/remove users, delete, reopen
   - Can interact with both claimed and unclaimed tickets

2. **Ticket Claimer** - A staff member who has claimed the ticket
   - Can perform all ticket actions on that ticket
   - Other staff members cannot interact with a claimed ticket - only the claimer and managers can

3. **Ticket Author** - The user who created the ticket
   - Can request to close the ticket (creates a close request rather than closing it directly)
   - Cannot perform other management actions

### Access Denied scenarios

- Non-staff users (without staff/manager roles) who are **not** the ticket author
- Non-manager staff trying to interact with a ticket claimed by another staff member
- The ticket author trying to perform management actions (other than requesting to close)

**Special case:** In the rare case when no staff roles and no manager roles are defined, all users are authorized to perform staff actions. This shoouldn't happen in practice, but it is a fallback to ensure tickets can still be managed.
