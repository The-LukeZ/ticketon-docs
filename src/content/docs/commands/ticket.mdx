This page explains how to use the `ticket` command.

The `/ticket` command is **not intended for public use**. It is primarily designed for server staff to manage support tickets efficiently.
Therefore, it requires `MODERATE_MEMBERS` permission by default.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand  | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| list        | Lists all open tickets                             |
| claim \*    | Claims a specified ticket for the command executor |
| unclaim \*  | Unclaims a specified ticket                        |
| add \*      | Adds up to 5 users to the ticket                   |
| remove \*   | Removes up to 5 users from the ticket              |
| move \*     | Moves the ticket to a different ticket category    |
| close \*    | Closes the ticket in which the command is executed |
| reopen \*\* | Reopens a specified closed ticket                  |
| delete \*\* | Deletes a specified ticket                         |

\* This command is expected to be used within a ticket channel.  
\*\* This command can be used directly within a ticket channel. When used outside a ticket channel, a ticket ID must be provided.

Because most commands should be self-explanatory, only the more complex ones are explained below.

### Move Ticket

The `move` subcommand allows you to move a ticket to a different ticket category.
This doesn't inherently change the parent category of the ticket channel in the server, but if the new ticket category has
a different category for open tickets, the ticket channel will be moved to that category.

After executing the command, the bot will send a confirmation message in the ticket channel that it was moved.
Additionally, the permissions of the ticket channel will be updated to match the new staff roles (if it's not a thread ticket).
