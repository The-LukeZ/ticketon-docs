This page explains how to use the `ticket` command.

The `/ticket` command is **not intended for public use**. It is primarily designed for server staff to manage support tickets efficiently.
Therefore, it requires `Moderate Members` permission by default.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand              | Description                                                     |

| reopen \*\*             | Reopens a specified closed ticket                               |
| delete \*\*             | Deletes a specified ticket                                      |

| delete-all              | Deletes all closed tickets in the server                        |
| who-claimed \*            | Displays the name of the person who claimed the ticket          |

\* This command is expected to be used within a ticket channel.  
\*\* This command can be used directly within a ticket channel. When used outside a ticket channel, a ticket ID must be provided.

Because most commands should be self-explanatory, only the more complex ones are explained below.

### Transfer Ticket

The `transfer` subcommand allows you to move a ticket to a different ticket category.
This doesn't inherently change the parent category of the ticket channel in the server, but if the new ticket category has
a different category for open tickets, the ticket channel will be moved to that category.

### Close Requests

Staff can use `/ticket close-request create` to create a close request for the ticket.

When a staff member creates a close request, the ticket author is asked if they have further questions or all issues have been resolved.  
Staff can also provide an **optional reason** for closing the ticket and an **optional close delay**.  
If they change their mind before the ticket is closed, staff can revoke a close request by executing the `/ticket close-request` revoke command in the ticket channel.

### Close All Tickets

The `/ticket close-all` command allows you to close all open tickets in your server with a single command. Optionally, you can provide a reason for closing the tickets and whether to delete the tickets after closing them.  
When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to close all open tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.

### Delete All Tickets

The `/ticket delete-all` command allows you to delete all closed tickets in your server with a single command.  
When you execute this command, the bot will attempt to delete all closed tickets. It does this in batches of 5 tickets at a time to avoid hitting rate limits.

### Check Who Claimed

The `/who-claimed` command will display the user who claimed the ticket. (Only works in tickets)
