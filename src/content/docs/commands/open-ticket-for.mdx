The `/open-ticket-for` command allows moderators to open a ticket on behalf of another user.
This can be useful in scenarios where mods need to talk to the user privately and not in a public channel.

This command is available to members with the **Moderate Members** permission by default.

## Options

- **User** (required): The user for whom the ticket will be created.
- **Category** (required): The ticket category for which the ticket will be created.
- **Custom Starter Message** (optional): Specify a custom message that will be sent in the ticket when it's created.
  If not provided, the starter message depends on the configuration of the selected category.

The behavior of this command may vary based on the configuration of the selected category.

| Custom Message Provided | Category has Form | Category has Starter Message | Result                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| No                      | No                | No                           | Default starter message    |
| No                      | No                | Yes                          | Configured starter message |
| No                      | Yes               | No                           | Default starter message    |
| No                      | Yes               | Yes                          | Default starter message    |
| Yes                     | No                | No                           | Custom message             |
| Yes                     | No                | Yes                          | Custom message             |
| Yes                     | Yes               | No                           | Custom message             |
| Yes                     | Yes               | Yes                          | Custom message             |

<Aside type="note">

In short: A custom message always takes precedence. If no custom message is provided, the default starter message is used if the category has a form, otherwise the configured starter message is used.

#### Blacklisted Users

It is still possbible to open tickets for users who are blacklisted from creating tickets themselves.
This can be useful if a moderator needs to open a ticket for a blacklisted user to discuss their behavior.
