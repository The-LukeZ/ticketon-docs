A server's support schedule determines when the server will be available to handle support requests.
You can configure the support schedule to match your team's working hours, ensuring that support requests are only handled during those times.

## How does a support schedule work?

Each server can only have one schedule. If it's not active, the server will always be available to handle support requests.

A support schedule holds daily schedules for each day of the week (Monday to Sunday). The start of the week doesn't matter -
this would be only relevant for displaying the schedule in a more user-friendly way. However, since this project is supposed to be simple,
the schedule is always displayed starting from Monday.

A day can have up to 3 time slots. When a user tries to create a ticket, the system checks the server's
support schedule to see if the current time falls within any of the defined time slots for that day.  
If that is the case, it determines the next available time slot for that day and tells the user when they should try to create a ticket again.

A time slot defines a specific period during which the server is available to handle support requests. A time slot is defined by a start time and an end time.

You can also configure your schedule's UTC offset, so that the schedule is always interpreted in the correct timezone.

## Configuring the support schedule

To configure a server's support schedule, navigate to the server's settings page and click on the "Schedule" tab.

Here, you can enable or disable the support schedule, set the UTC offset, and define the daily schedules for each day of the week.

When defining a daily schedule, you can add up to 3 time slots for each day. Click on the "Add Time Slot" button to add a new time slot.
