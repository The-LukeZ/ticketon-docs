Messages are a core part of how Ticketon interacts with your server. You can customize the content and layout of most
messages sent by Ticketon to better fit your server's style and needs.

## What are Custom Messages for?

Custom messages can be used to:

- Ticket Starter Message: The message sent in a ticket, when a user creates a ticket.
- Panel Message: A message for instructions and button(s)/select menu(s) to create tickets.
- Snippets: Reusable message templates for common responses or information.

## Editing Messages

You can edit custom messages in the [Dashboard](https://ticketon.app/dash/?next=/messages).
Select the server you want to manage, then navigate to the "Messages" tab.

## Anatomy of a Message

A message is made up of a unique name (per server) and up to 40 components (Discord limit).

**Ticketon exclusively uses Components V2 for its messages.**

  Discord's Message Components V2 allow you to build rich, interactive messages
  with complex layouts. It can be quite difficult to understand at first, so
  remember:

  **Components V2 have nothing to do with embeds and work completely
  different.**
