Categories, also called **Ticket Categories**, are used to organize and classify tickets within the system. They help in grouping similar types of tickets together, making it easier for support staff to manage and prioritize their workload.

<Aside type="note">
  Some options are dependent on other settings and have specific behaviors. For
  example, if `Use Threads` is enabled, the `Open Ticket Category` and `Closed
  Ticket Category` options will be ignored, as threads do not require category
  channels.

#### Role Config

The `Role Config` option allows you to set up role-based access control for the category. It consists of two properties:

- `roles`: An array of role IDs that are either allowed or denied access based on the `mode`.
- `mode`: Can be either `blacklist` or `whitelist`. In `blacklist` mode, the roles in the `roles` array are denied access. In `whitelist` mode, only the roles in the `roles` array are granted access.

## Additional Information

### Category Emoji

The category emoji is used to visually represent the category in a category select menu in a custom message.
It helps users quickly identify and select the desired category when creating a ticket.

### Naming Template

The naming template allows you to customize how ticket channels or threads are named when they are created. You can use the following placeholders in the template:

- `{username}`: The username of the user who created the ticket.
- `{index}`: A unique index number for the ticket, starting from 1.
- `{category}`: The sanitized name of the category. E.g. "General Support" becomes "general-support".

### Form Management

You can select a form to be associated with the category. When a user selects this category while creating a ticket, they will be presented with the specified form to fill out.

Each form component has a unique ID, which can be used in the selected custom message to display the input/selected values.  
Note, that no custom message if configured, the default message will be used and the form values will just be shown there.
