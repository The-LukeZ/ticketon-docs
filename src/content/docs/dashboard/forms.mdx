The **Form Management** page allows you to create and manage forms for your server. Forms can be used for various purposes,
such as collecting information before creating a ticket or gathering feedback from users.

## Form Options

A form has the following configurable options:

#### Checkbox Workaround

Currently, there is no dedicated checkbox component. However, you can simulate a checkbox using a `String Select Menu` with two options: "Yes" and "No". This allows users to select either option, effectively functioning as a checkbox.

## File Uploads

When using the **File Upload** component, please note the following limitations:

- Maximum file size corresponds to the server's upload limit **or** the upload limit of the user if they have Nitro.
- Supported file types are determined by Discord and may change over time.

### File Upload Message Label

When configuring a **File Upload** component, you can set a custom label for the upload field in the form. However the **Message Label** is something different.

When the ticket is created, the bot will create a public thread on the starter message to store the uploaded files.
This is the best and most user friendly way to handle upload limitations and ensure the context for every uploaded file is clear.

#### Example:

The server doesn't have Boost level 2, so the upload limit is 10MB. The user filling out the form has Nitro, so their upload limit is 500MB.

The form has two upload fields with the following configurations:

- Field 1:
  - Label: "Upload your Avatar"
  - Message Label: "Avatar"
- Field 2:
  - Label: "Proof of being a fruit"
  - Message Label: "Fruits"
  - Max Files: 3

The user uploads the following files:

- Field 1: `avatar.png` (3MB)
- Field 2: `apple.png` (9MB), `peach.png` (5MB), `all_fruits.mp4` (120MB)

The bot will create the following messages in the thread:

**Message 1:**

- Content: "Avatar"
- Attachments: `avatar.png`

  The avatar file is uploaded successfully since it is within the size limit.

**Message 2:**

- Content: "Fruits"
- Attachments: `apple.png` (9MB)

  The first apple file is uploaded successfully, because it is within the size limit.

**Message 3:**

- Content: "Fruits" + link to `all_fruits.mp4`
- Attachments: `peach.png`

  The second apple file is uploaded successfully, because it is within the size limit.
  The third file `all_fruits.mp4` exceeds the size limit and is therefore not uploaded, however it is added to the content as a link so the upload can still be accessed.

See? Every form field gets its own message with a clear label and context! If the uploads exceed the size limit of the message,
The bot will automatically group attachments together so they fit within the limit, while still keeping the context clear with the message label. Note, that because the bot iterates over the files in order, the order of files in the messages may seem a bit random if some files exceed the size limit.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The Message Label is optional. If not provided, the bot will use the field
  label as the message label.

Example: If the field label is "Upload your Avatar" and no message label is provided,
the bot will send the attachments with the message content "Upload your Avatar".
