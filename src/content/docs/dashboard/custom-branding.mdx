Custom Branding is a feature that allows you to customize Ticketon's appearance to better match
your server's style and branding.

## What can be customized?

- **Bot Avatar**: Change the bot's avatar to a custom image.
- **Bot Banner**: Set a custom banner image for the bot's profile.
- **Bot Bio**: Write a custom bio (about me) for the bot.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Custom Branding is just a "branding" - not a custom bot. Discord released an
  update recently that allows bots to customize their profile per server.

## How to configure Custom Branding

To configure Custom Branding, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://ticketon.app/dash/?next=/custom-branding).

There you can upload your custom avatar and banner images, and write your custom bio.

Make sure to save your changes once you're done.

## Custom Username

While you cannot set a custom username for the bot, you can change its nickname in your server.
This can be done by right-clicking the bot in your server member list and selecting "Change Nickname".
This allows you to give the bot a name that fits your server's theme.
