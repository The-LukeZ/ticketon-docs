Transcripts are an essential part of the ticketing system, providing a complete record of all conversations within support tickets.

They capture messages, attachments, and timestamps, enabling server administrators and moderators to review interactions,
ensure compliance with community guidelines, and maintain a searchable history for future reference.
This feature promotes accountability and helps resolve disputes by preserving the full context of tickets.

## How do transcripts work?

Transcripts are automatically generated when a ticket is closed. The bot reads all messages in the ticket channel
and creates a formatted transcript file that includes all messages, attachments, and timestamps.

The transcript file is then sent to a designated channel for record-keeping.

To also send the transcript to the user who opened the ticket, set the **Transcript Privacy Mode** to `Public` in the server settings.

## How do I view transcripts?

Since Discord attachment URLs expire after 24 hours, the URL must be dynamically generated each time you want to view it.
The generated transcript URL is valid for 24 hours, after which it will expire, requiring you to generate a new one.

Simply click the **Get Transcript URL** button on the transcript message (or direct message) to retrieve the URL.

<Aside type="note">
  Transcript URLs are not authenticated. However, they consist of a ticket's
  unique ID and transcript key, making them nearly impossible to guess - especially since
  they are only valid for 24 hours.

Additionally, the ticket's ID cannot be manually displayed except in the transcript URL button.
This ensures that only individuals with access to the transcript message or direct message
can view the transcript.

## Preserving transcript images

By default, images in transcripts are embedded directly into the transcript file.
However, due to Discord's limitations, transcripts cannot exceed a certain size.
If a transcript becomes too large to upload, images may be removed and will only be displayed as a link.

With the **Unlimited Plan**, images can be preserved by uploading them to our secure CDN.
These images will remain accessible for six months after the ticket is closed. This ensures that even large transcripts retain their full context.

<Aside type="note">
  Only images are preserved. Other file types will be available as links. Images
  larger than 50 MB cannot be preserved due to storage limitations.
