## 21.10.2025

- Added the functionality to DM the user who added the bot to a server.
  - THis works with discord's webhook events feature, where I would get notified when the bot is added to a server, and then I can send a DM to the user who added it.

## 20.10.2025

- Fixed a bug where the ticket channel would be publicly visible to all users.
  - The underlying issue was that the permission overwrites for the ticket channel would set the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to `false` but the overwrite type was set to `member` instead of `role`, causing the permission to not apply correctly.
