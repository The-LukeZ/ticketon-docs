### Tickets Page

After much consideration, I have decided to change the feedback page into a tickets page. This page will allow server administrators to view the tickets of their server, along with detailed information about each ticket.

Additionally, if a ticket has feedback, it will be displayed on the ticket details page.

### Feedback Page

- Added a comprehensive feedback management page in the dashboard that allows server administrators to view and analyze user feedback about their support ticket experience.
  - The backend uses MongoDB aggregation to join feedback documents with their corresponding tickets, allowing filtering by category while maintaining performance. Date range filters support ISO timestamps, and rating filters accept comma-separated values for multi-select functionality.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  It is very likely that this page will be turned into a tickets page in the
  future, so you can not only view feedback in the dashboard, but also detailed
  information about tickets themselves. Not sure how this will look yet.

## 21.10.2025

- Added the functionality to DM the user who added the bot to a server.
  - This works with discord's webhook events feature, where I would get notified when the bot is added to a server, and then I can send a DM to the user who added it.

## 20.10.2025

- Fixed a bug where the ticket channel would be publicly visible to all users.
  - The underlying issue was that the permission overwrites for the ticket channel would set the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to `false` but the overwrite type was set to `member` instead of `role`, causing the permission to not apply correctly.
