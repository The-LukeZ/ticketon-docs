User reports allow your community members to report other users for violations of server rules.
This guide will walk you through setting up a complete user reporting system.

## Overview

The user reporting system consists of five main steps:

<Steps>

1. Create a custom form with report fields
2. Add form fields for user selection and report details
3. Create a starter message to acknowledge the report
4. Set up a "Report" ticket category
5. Add the category to a panel message

</Steps>

## Step 1: Create a Form

First, you'll need to create a form that will collect the report information.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the [Forms](https://ticketon.app/?next=/forms) section in your dashboard
2. Click **New Form**
3. Give your form a clear name like **User Report**
4. Save the form

</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Form Fields

Add the following fields to your form to collect report information:

#### User Select Menu (Required)

This field lets the reporter select which user they're reporting.

- **Field Type:** User Select Menu
- **Label:** "User to Report"
- **Required:** Yes
- **Custom ID:** `reported_user` (you'll reference this in the starter message)

#### Message Link (Optional)

This field allows the reporter to provide a link to a relevant message as evidence.

- **Field Type:** Text Input
- **Label:** "Message Link (Optional)"
- **Placeholder:** "https://discord.com/channels/..."
- **Required:** No
- **Custom ID:** `message_link`

#### Reason (Required)

This field collects the reason for the report.

- **Field Type:** Text Input
- **Style:** Paragraph
- **Label:** "Reason for Report"
- **Placeholder:** "Please describe why you're reporting this user..."
- **Required:** Yes
- **Custom ID:** `report_reason`

<Aside type="caution">
  Make sure to set unique custom IDs for each field. You'll need these to
  reference the field values in your starter message.
</Aside>

## Step 3: Create a Starter Message

The starter message will be displayed when a ticket is created, confirming the report submission.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the [Messages](https://ticketon.app/?next=/messages) section
2. Click **Create New Message**
3. Name it something like "Report Starter Message"
4. Create a message that acknowledges the report and displays the submitted information

</Steps>

<details>
   <summary>Example Starter Message</summary>

```md
Thank you for submitting your report. A staff member will review it shortly.

**Reported User:** {reported_user}
**Message Link:** {message_link}
**Reason:** {report_reason}

Please remain patient while our moderation team investigates this report.
```

</details>

<Aside type="note">
  Use the custom IDs you set in Step 2 inside curly braces `{custom_id}` to
  display the form field values dynamically.
</Aside>

## Step 4: Create a Report Category

Now you'll create a dedicated ticket category for user reports.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the [Categories](https://ticketon.app/?next=/categories) section
2. Click **Create New Category**
3. Name it "Report"
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Form:** Select the "User Report Form" you created
   - **Starter Message:** Select the "Report Starter Message"
   - **Permissions:** Configure who can view and manage report tickets
   - **Channel Settings:** Set the category where report tickets will be created
   - **Staff Roles:** Assign appropriate moderator roles that have permissions to take action on users

</Steps>

## Step 5: Add to Panel Message

Finally, make the report category accessible to users through a panel message.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Create a New Panel">

   <Steps>

      1. Create a new panel message specifically for reports
      2. Add a button or select menu option that triggers the "Report" category
      3. Place the panel in a dedicated reporting channel

   </Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Add to Existing Panel">

   <Steps>

      1. Edit your existing ticket panel message
      2. Add a new button or option for the "Report" category
      3. Label it clearly (e.g., "ðŸš¨ Report a User")
      4. Save and update the panel

   </Steps>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple:** Don't add too many fields that might discourage reporting
- **Make evidence optional:** Not all reports will have message links, maybe a user is reporting DM spam or a profile
- **Update status:** Keep reporters informed if investigations take time
- **Protect privacy:** Don't share details about actions taken against reported users

## Troubleshooting

### Field values not showing in starter message

Make sure you're using the exact custom ID from your form fields, wrapped in curly braces: `{custom_id}`

### Users can't see the report option

Check that your panel message is properly configured and that users have permission to create tickets in the Report category.

### Reports aren't being created

Ensure that the bot has either **Manage Server** permissions or **Manage Channels** and **Manage Permissions** in the category where the report tickets should be created.
