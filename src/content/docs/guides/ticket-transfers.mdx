## Overview

Transferring tickets between categories in Ticketon is a straightforward process that can be accomplished using either the
ticket controls or the `/transfer ticket` command. This guide will walk you through the steps to transfer tickets effectively.

The process if pretty much the same in both cases, with some differences noted below.

## Using Ticket Controls

1. In the ticket you want to transfer, go all the way up to the ticket controls at the top of the channel.
2. From the select menu, choose **Transfer Ticket**. A modal (form) will appear.
3. In the modal, select the new category you want to transfer the ticket to, as well as a comment (optional) and the **With Form** option.
   Click **Submit** to finish
4. If you selected the **With Form** option and the new category has a form, the bot will send a message to the ticket channel
   with a button that the user can click to fill out the form. If you did not select this option, the ticket will be transferred immediately.

## Using the `/transfer ticket` Command

1. In the ticket you want to transfer, use the `/transfer ticket` command. Use the command's options to specify the new category,
   a comment (optional) and whether you want to use the **With Form** option.
2. If you selected the **With Form** option and the new category has a form, the bot will send a message to the ticket channel
   with a button that the user can click to fill out the form. If you did not select this option, the ticket will be transferred immediately.

## Additional Information

- By default, the user will **not** be asked to fill out the form (when there is one). You need to explicitly select the **With Form** option
  in order to have the user fill out the form before transferring.
- If the ticket author is asked to fill out the form, they are not forced to do so. They can choose to ignore it and the ticket will remain
  in the original category. Maybe an option for this will be added in the future.

## Filling out the form for the new category

When the ticket author clicks the button to fill out the form for the new category, they will be presented with the form
like when they would when creating a new ticket. Once they submit the form, the ticket will be transferred to the new category.

The message asking the user to fill out the form will be edited to a "Ticket transferred" message once the form is submitted and
the starter message of the new category will be sent in the ticket channel.
