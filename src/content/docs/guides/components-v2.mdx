Discord's Message Components V2 allow you to build rich, interactive messages with complex layouts. This guide provides a quick reference for all available components.

**Ticketon exclusively uses Components V2 for its messages.**

## Layout Components

Layout components help you organize and structure your message content.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Action Row" icon="list-format">
    A container for a row of interactive components. It can hold up to **5
    buttons** or a **single select menu**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Section" icon="comment-alt">
    Displays text content alongside an "accessory" component (a button or
    thumbnail).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Container" icon="document">
    Visually groups a set of components together, with an optional colored
    accent bar on the side. It basically looks like an embed, but doesn't have
    the same fields. It can also be spoilered.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Separator" icon="bars">
    Adds vertical spacing and an optional visual divider line between other
    components.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Content Components

Content components are used to display static information like text, images, and files.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Text Display" icon="seti:default">
    Displays **Markdown-formatted text**, similar to a standard message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Media Gallery" icon="pnpm">
    Displays a gallery of **1-10 images** or other media items in an organized
    grid. Media items can be spoilered.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Thumbnail" icon="seti:image">
    A **small image**, used as an accessory in a `Section` component. It can be
    spoilered.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Interactive Components

These components allow users to interact with the bot. With the exception of buttons used as a section accessory, all interactive components must be placed within an `Action Row`.

### Buttons

Buttons trigger actions when clicked. They must be placed in an `Action Row` or used as an accessory in a `Section`.

Button in Ticketon server two purposes:

1. **Link Button**: Opens a URL in the user's browser.
2. **Create Ticket Button**: Starts the ticket creation process for the configured category.

### Category Selection Menu

A Category Selection Menu is a special type of Select Menu, that holds a list of ticket categories to choose from.
When a user selects a category, it starts the ticket creation process for that category.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Can I mix and match components from V1 and V2?</summary>

No. Ticketon exclusively uses Components V2 for its messages. Additionally, Discord does not allow mixing V1 and V2 components in the same message.
It's either **embeds + action rows** or **components V2 only**.
