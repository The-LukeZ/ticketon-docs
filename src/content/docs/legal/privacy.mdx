## 1. Introduction

I am comitted to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
use, and share information when you use Ticketon services, including our Discord bot and web dashboard (the "Service").

## 2.Summary

We do not collect any personal data. We use all information provided by you while using the Service
solely to provide and improve the Service. We do not sell or share your data with third parties
except as necessary to provide the Service or comply with legal obligations.

All metadata (not content) of messages in your server will be used, processed to provide the Service, and may be stored.

We may use third-party services for hosting, analytics, and payment processing. These providers
are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations. We may update this Privacy Policy
from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes means acceptance of the updated policy.

## 3. Use of the website and dashboard

Only the data that you actively save by clicking "Save ..." after modifying your configuration is stored together with your personal data on Sapphire's website or dashboard.
This is necessary to provide Sapphire's services. Your personal data is not stored or tracked automatically.

## 4. Use of the Discord bot within Discord

When using Ticketon in your Discord server, you allow LukeZ to see and process all of your server's information Sapphire has access to.

### 4.1 Transcripts

When a ticket is closed, Ticketon generates a transcript of the ticket channel. This transcript includes all messages,
attachments (images are embedded into it), and metadata (timestamps, user IDs, etc.) from the ticket channel.

This transcript is sent into a ticket log channel if configured and may be sent to the author of the ticket, no other copies.

More on Image Preservation below.

### 4.2 Brand features

When you enable features that access or display your server's metadata (such as server's name and icon),
you grant Ticketon a non-exclusive right to use those assets, for any reasons, including but not limited to marketing purposes.

## 5. Use of Ticketon's Unlimited features

When you subscribe to Ticketon's paid "Unlimited" plan, additional data is collected and processed to manage your subscription. This includes:

- Payment information: We use Paddle to process payments. Paddle collects and processes your payment details, such as credit card information and billing address. We do not store your full payment details.
- Subscription status: We store your subscription and customer ID to manage your access to paid features.

Please refer to Paddle's <Link href="https://paddle.com/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</Link> and <Link href="https://paddle.com/legal/terms/">Terms</Link> for more information on how they handle your data.

## 6. Image Preservation

When you are a subscriber of Ticketon's paid "Unlimited" plan, you can enable image preservation.

This allows Ticketon to upload images on messages in tickets to our object storage (Cloudflare R2) to preserve them for transcripts and to serve them in the transcript viewer on the website.
Images are retained for up to six months after the ticket is closed, unless you, the server owner, or applicable law requires different handling.

Images are only accessible via links used in transcripts and the dashboard. We take reasonable measures to secure stored assets but cannot guarantee absolute security.

Do not upload sensitive personal information unless you have a lawful basis and have taken appropriate consent.

We are not responsible for images that are uploaded - you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to upload and share any images you upload.

## 7. Use of Message Content Intent

The bot uses the "Message Content Intent" to read the content of messages in ticket channels to provide the ticketing functionality.

This intent is required for the bot to read and log messages in ticket channels, generate transcripts, and provide features.
The bot does not store or process message content outside of ticket channels, and message content is only used to provide the ticketing functionality.

Message content is not stored, only processed and not shared with anyone.

## 8. Data Retention

### 8.1 Guild Data

We retain guild data (settings, configurations) as long as you use Ticketon in your server. If you remove the bot from your server, we will retain this data for 7 days to allow for reinstallation. After this period, guild data will be deleted.

If you wish to delete your guild data immediately after removing the bot, please enable this setting in the dashboard before removing the bot.

### 8.2 User Data

The access token will expire after seven days, but it may be stored for a longer period. Please be advised that if no updates are made to your data for a period of one year, it will be deleted.

Should you wish to request the immediate deletion of your user data, please send an email to contact@ticketon.app.

Please be advised that any direct messages you send to the bot will result in the collection of new data.

### 8.3 Transcript Data

Transcripts of closed tickets are not stored on our servers, but are uploaded to a Discord channel if configured, and may be sent to the ticket author.
