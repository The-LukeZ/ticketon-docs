## 1. About this service

Ticketon is a hosted Discord ticketing bot and related web dashboard provided by **LukeZ Development - Inh. Luca Hentschel** ("Ticketon", "we", "us", "our", "I", "my").
The service automates ticket creation, management, and transcript generation inside Discord servers.
Use of Ticketon is governed by these Terms of Service and by Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policies.
By enabling or using Ticketon you agree to these Terms.

## 2. License

Subject to compliance with these Terms, Ticketon grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable license to use the Service for your Discord server(s). This license does not grant ownership of Ticketon
software, source code, or underlying infrastructure. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Ticketon.

## 3. Restrictions on your use of Ticketon

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for illegal activity, harassment, spam, or other activities that violate Discord's rules or applicable law.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code or service internals.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, attempt to bypass rate limits, or exploit security vulnerabilities.
- Use Ticketon to store or distribute malicious content, infringing material, or personal data in violation of privacy laws.
- Misrepresent your relationship with Ticketon or impersonate the service in ways that could confuse users.

Ticket owners and server administrators remain responsible for content posted by their members and for configuring Ticketon features in compliance with applicable rules and law.

## 4. Unlimited as a paid service

Ticketon may offer paid plans (for example "Unlimited") that provide increased limits, storage, or premium features.
Paid plans are governed by the pricing, billing, and refund terms presented at purchase. Subscriptions renew until canceled.
Ticketon may suspend or modify paid features with notice if business or technical needs require it.

### 5. Payments

Paddle is fully responsible for processing your payments.
If you have any issue or questions about your payments, please contact them directly: https://paddle.net/

Invoices that have to be paid by you are sent to you by the email you provided during checkout.
Usually, all invoices are automatically paid using your provided payment details if not stated otherwise.

To change your payment method or billing details, please visit the billing portal for which you can get the link in the dashboard [here](https://ticketon.app/dash/billing).

### Your Right of Withdrawal

Please see [here](/legal/right-of-withdrawal).

## 6. Outages, Termination, General Service

- Availability: We aim to keep Ticketon available but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may perform maintenance or experience outages.
- Termination: We may terminate or suspend access for violation of these Terms, abuse, non-payment, or security concerns.
  You may terminate your use at any time by kicking the bot from your server or canceling your subscription.
- Backups and Data: We keep backups of your data to ensure service continuity, but do not offer data recovery at the moment.
  We may retain logs and transcripts per our policies; deletion requests will be handled in accordance with applicable privacy rules.
- No warranty: The Service is provided "as is" without warranties. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ticketon disclaims implied warranties of merchantability,
  fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- Limitation of liability: Ticketon's liability is limited to the extent permitted by applicable law and as described in our support documentation.

## 7. Usage of your brand's features

By using Ticketon features that access or display your server's metadata (such as server's name and icon),
you grant Ticketon a non-exclusive right to use those assets, including but not limited:

- For operation of the Service (e.g., displaying server name in the dashboard, generating transcripts).
- For support, diagnostics, and troubleshooting.
- For marketing or promotional materials (e.g., screenshots, case studies, social media), unless you explicitly opt out by contacting support.
  Ticketon will not claim ownership of your brand assets. If you need a specific restriction on the use of your server name or logo, contact support and we will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests.

## 8. Third party services

Payments, subscriptions, and billing for paid plans may be processed by third-party providers ([Paddle](https://paddle.com)).
Use of such services is also subject to the third party's terms and privacy policies.
Ticketon is not responsible for the third party's actions or policies. Any disputes about billing or refunds processed through a third party should be raised with that provider according to their dispute process; we will cooperate to the extent reasonable.

## 9. Uploading images to our CDN

- Purpose: When you enable image preservation or upload images via the Service (for images attached to ticket messages), Ticketon may store those images on our object storage (Cloudflare R2) to preserve them for transcripts and to serve them in the dashboard.
- Retention: Images stored for transcript preservation are retained for the period disclosed in our product documentation (e.g., up to six months) unless you, the server owner, or applicable law requires different handling.
- Limits: We may restrict file types, sizes, and total storage. Large files or unsupported types may be rejected.
- Security and access: Stored images are accessible via links used in transcripts and the dashboard.
  We take reasonable measures to secure stored assets but cannot guarantee absolute security.
  Do not upload sensitive personal information unless you have a lawful basis and have taken appropriate consent and protection measures.
- Deletion: Images may be deleted after retention expires or by request. We are not responsible for images that are removed due to storage limits or policy enforcement.
- Cloud provider terms: Use of Cloudflare R2 or other providers is subject to their terms. We may change storage providers and will preserve data where feasible during migrations.

## 10. Miscellaneous

- Changes: We may update these Terms; material changes will be announced via the dashboard or [changelog](/changelogs/overview). Continued use after changes means acceptance.
- Governing law: These Terms are governed by applicable law as stated in our documentation or jurisdiction details.
- Contact: For questions, brand-use opt-out requests, or support, contact us via the dashboard or Discord (https://ticketon.app/discord).
