## Getting Started (Finally!)

### 1. Invite Ticketon to your server

<LinkButton href="https://ticketon.app/invite" target="_blank" icon="external">
  Invite Bot
</LinkButton>

### 2. Create a Ticket Category

Go to the <Link href="https://ticketon.app/dash?next=/categories">Dashboard</Link> and login with your Discord account.

Then, select your server, navigate to the **Categories** tab, and click on **Add Category**. Great! You have successfully created your first ticket category.

### 3. Configure your Ticket Category

The layout is simple and intuitive.

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Desktop" icon="laptop">
    You have two tabs: **Message Overview** and **Settings**. You have a Dock at the bottom to switch between the two tabs.

    By clicking on a message in the overview, it loads the configuration options and switches the tab to **Settings**.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mobile" icon="phone">
    The page is divided into two sections: **Message Overview** on the left and **Settings** on the right.

    By clicking on a message in the overview, it loads the configuration options on the right side.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You need to change the following settings to get started:

- **Open Tickets Category**: The category where open tickets will be created.
- Change the Category Status to **Active**.

<Aside type="caution">Don't forget to save your changes!</Aside>

### 4. Make a Custom Message

Go to the <Link href="https://ticketon.app/dash?next=/messages">Messages</Link> tab in the dashboard and click on **Add Message**.

### 5. Customize the Message

Congratulations, you have created your first custom message! Now you can customize your message.

This message can be used for anything you like, but you want to make a message which will be used as a **Panel Message**.

### 6. Send the Panel

When you are done customizing your message, click on **Save Messages** at the top to save your message.

<Aside type="note">
  When on Mobile, this automatically switches you to the **Overview** tab again.
  So you need to click on the message now to change the tab to **Settings**
  again.
</Aside>

Now click on the blue **Settings** button besides the message name to open the settings of this message.

Here you can paste in a channel link where the panel should be sent to.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can also paste a Message Link to edit an existing panel message.
</Aside>

### Quick Start Checklist

- ✅ Invite Ticketon with the recommended permissions (see Troubleshooting).
- ✅ Create a Category and set it to **Active**.
- ✅ Add at least one Custom Message.
- ✅ Paste a Channel Link or Message Link in the message settings and click **Send**.
- ✅ Open a test ticket to confirm staff can see and manage it.

### Panel & Message link formats

Paste either a channel link to send a new panel or an existing message link to edit:

```python
# Channel link (sends a new panel message)
https://discord.com/channels/<server_id>/<channel_id>

# Message link (edits an existing panel message)
https://discord.com/channels/<server_id>/<channel_id>/<message_id>
```

Tip: If a link doesn't work, ensure you copied the full URL and the bot has access to the target channel.

### Common Troubleshooting

#### Panel doesn't appear / can't send message

- Ensure Ticketon has View Channel and Send Messages in the target channel.
- Check role hierarchy — the bot's role must be above any roles it needs to manage.

#### Users can't create tickets

- Verify category permissions to allow the bot to create channels and manage permissions.
- Ensure the category is set to **Active** in the dashboard and the category for open tickets is set.

#### Slash commands missing

- Re-invite the bot or wait a few minutes for commands to register; sometimes guild commands are faster.
  Sometimes pressing `CTRL`+`R` / `CMD`+`R` in Discord helps.

Recommended permissions (at minimum)

- View Channels
- Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files
- Manage Channels (for creating ticket channels)
- Manage Roles (if Ticketon assigns roles)
- Read Message History

### Best practices

- Name categories clearly, e.g. "General Support", "Bug Report", "Billing".
- Limit staff roles to trusted moderators.
- Use Forms to capture essential info (issue type, what was tried, etc) before ticket creation.
- Keep panel messages short and add clear labels to buttons.
