## What is the Unlimited Plan?

The Unlimited Plan is designed for users who need more resources and flexibility than the Free Plan offers. It provides unlimited access to all features and removes any usage caps.

<Aside type="note" icon="information" title="Note">
  There are still some limitations on the Unlimited Plan, but it's unlikely
  you'll hit them. If you do, please reach out to our support by creating a
  ticket in [Discord](https://ticketon.app/discord).

## Comparison

<small>
  Note, that the Free Plan is designed to offer the best experience possible for
  casual users, while the Unlimited Plan is tailored for power users and larger
  communities with higher demands.

#### What does "Preserve Transcript Images" mean?

Images in transcripts are embedded into the transcript file.
However, due to Discord's limitations, transcripts cannot be infinite in size. Therefore, any image that results in a transcript larger than what can be uploaded to Discord depending on the server's boost level will be removed from the transcript.

To preserve transcript images, the images will be uploaded to our own CDN for six months after the ticket is closed.  
One workaround is to enable Threads for a category because thread tickets will not be deleted by the bot.
As long as the user doesn't delete their messages, the images will stay in the transcript.

**Only images are preserved!** Any other file type will just be available as a
link. Images larger than 50 MB will not be preserved due to storage
limitations. (50MB for a single image is really big, this shouldn't be a problem)

## Pricing

The Unlimited Plan is available for a monthly fee of $3.99 or an annual fee of €25.00, which saves you 30% compared to the monthly plan.

<details>
  <summary>Why is the annual plan in EUR while the monthly plan is in USD?</summary>

    I (the developer) am based in Germany, so the better question is, **why is the monthly plan in USD?** Well, the answer is simple: Discord is forcing developers to use their in-app purchase system for subscriptions which only supports USD and non-customizable pricing.

    So we **have** to use USD for the monthly plan. The catch here is, that Discord takes a large cut of the revenue - if you pay with Paddle through the dashboard, we benefit more from your subscription.

  We encourage users to subscribe directly through the dashboard to support the
  project more effectively.
